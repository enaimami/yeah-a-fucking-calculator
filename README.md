# yeah-a-fucking-calculator

A calculator. Yes, another one. The 67th million calculator on GitHub.

Because apparently every engineer needs to do this at some point. At least everyone's GitHub page give me this idea

## Features
- Addition (probably works)
- Subtraction (hopefully works)
- Multiplication (tested once)
- Division

## Installation
```bash
git clone yeah-a-fucking-calculator
make
